# Epistemics Department SOP
These are the list of SOPs that Epistemics Personnel should follow. These are, as stated before, [bold]not checklists[/bold] and should be treated as guidelines.

<Box>For clarification, Golemancer can extend to any Epistemics personnel working on Robots.</Box>

It is expected that [color=#cc74fc]Noviciate[/color], [color=#cc74fc]Acolyte[/color], and [color=#cc74fc]Mystic[/color] coincide in the same SOP guidelines. This is to consolidate the guidelines.

- [color=#cc74fc]Chaplain[/color] overseeing the Oracle and Sacrifices.
