  # Core Rule 15 - There are higher standards of roleplay, and you are expected to meet these standards
  There are higher standards of roleplay compared to Goob LRP. You are expected to meet these standards or be punished/banned for breaking them.

  Goob Station is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character.
  This includes doing your job, interacting with your fellow crewmates, and using roleplay as the primary vessel to play the game.

  Medium Roleplay places less emphasis on “winning” and more on just telling a story.
