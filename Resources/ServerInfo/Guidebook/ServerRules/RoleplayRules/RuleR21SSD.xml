  # Roleplay Rule 21 - AFK (aka SSD) are considered to have the same rights as a conscious crewmate
  All away-from-keyboard (AFK) and sudden-sleep-disorder (SSD) players are considered conscious crewmates and should be treated like they are still actively playing the game.

  This means you cannot strip them, kill them, perform surgery on them, or otherwise interact with them in any way that you wouldn't normally interact.

  This rule does not extend to antagonists that have an AFK/SSD player as a target. They may interact with them as an antagonist normally would.
