  # Roleplay Rule 20 - End-of-round grief (EORG) is not allowed
  You are to follow the same rules as if the round were still continuing during the End of Round gameplay (when the End of Round summary has shown up).

  This includes attacking, destroying, polluting, and/or injuring without reason both *at* and *on the way to* Central Command.

  This also extends to the following:
    - Neutral parties, such as space dragons or sentient artifacts activating harmful nodes.
    - Attempts to block the docking ports or ports leading into Central Command.
