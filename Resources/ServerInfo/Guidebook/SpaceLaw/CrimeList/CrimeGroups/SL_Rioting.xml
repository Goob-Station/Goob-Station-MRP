  # Rioting (R)
  Rioting comes in many forms, but primarily is associated with the violent nature of an organized group of individuals that
  cause damages and/or harm other members of the station.

  ## Rioting
  Rioting refers to the act of associating oneself as a member in a group which collectively commits acts of vandalism, or other felony crimes.

  ## Subversion of Command
  Subversion of Command refers to intentionally attempting to overthrow the Chain of Command on the station, including Dignitaries in this as well.
  Another description would be: Disrupting the chain of command via either murder of a commanding officer or illegally declaring oneself to be a commanding officer.

      Security officers are not considered to be commanding officers. Heads of Staff, Captains, Central Command Officials, and Dignitaries are.
      This does not include replacement of heads of staff with solid reasoning backing it. (Derelection, Negligence, Unfit for Job, et cetera.)
