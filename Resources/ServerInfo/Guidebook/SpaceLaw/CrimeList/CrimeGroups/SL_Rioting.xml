  # Rioting (R)
  Rioting comes in many forms, but primarily is associated with the violent nature of an organized group of individuals that
  cause damages and/or harm other members of the station.

  ## Rioting
  Rioting refers to the act of associating oneself as a member in a group which collectively commits acts of vandalism, or other felony crimes.
  - A riot typically constitutes five or more people acting in a coordinated effort. This can however vary on the size and circumstances of the station.

  ## Inciting a Riot
  Inciting a Riot refers to performing actions in the interest of causing large amounts of unrest up to and including rioting.
  - This is for the ring leader in any insurrection or riot.
  - Prisoners may have their radios removed and be contained in areas which are not visible to the general populace.

  ## Subversion of Command
  Subversion of Command refers to intentionally attempting to overthrow the Chain of Command on the station, including Dignitaries in this as well.
  Another description would be: Disrupting the chain of command via either murder of a commanding officer or illegally declaring oneself to be a commanding officer.
  - Security officers are not considered to be commanding officers. Heads of Staff, Captains, Central Command Officials, and Dignitaries are.
  - This does not include replacement of heads of staff with solid reasoning backing it. (Derelection, Negligence, Unfit for Job, et cetera.)
