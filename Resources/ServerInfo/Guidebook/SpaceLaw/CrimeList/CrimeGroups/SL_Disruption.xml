  # Disruption and Disturbances (X)
  Disruptions and Disturbances of Peace relate to matters concerning blatant misuse of Communications and organization of movements to disrupt
  normal operations of a department, not related to Rioting.

  There are several differences between these two, but they are classified under Disruptions in general for easier convenience of charges and escalation
  when there are minor changes. Disruptive Communications can easily lead to Distrubances of Peace.

  ## Disruptive Communications (Disruption)
  Disruptive Communications boils down to simple misuse of Communications Channels in Department or Common. This can be affiliated with spamming
  unnecessary information or repetitive words into the Communications Channel, to using Communications Channels for unnecessary chatter not necessary
  for the respective channel.
  - Some examples could pertain to spamming the channels. Others would be conversations that could be done so locally or in-private over
  a communications channel that doesn't pertain to the conversation or scenario.
  - This is a liberally taken and decisive charge to apply
  to someone, so it is classified as an infraction and should be warned before prosecuting such charges.

  ## Disturbance of Peace
  The Disturbance of Peace charge is a minor form of organization that does not become violent like Rioting, hence the Minor Severity of the charge.
  - To knowingly organize a movement which disrupts the normal operations of a department, or being a public disturbance.
