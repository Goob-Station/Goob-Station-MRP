  # Drug Possession and Distribution (D)
  Drug Possession and Drug Distribution are two separate crimes that cannot be stackable. If the offender is distributing drugs, they take
  the higher severity offense, Drug Distribution.

  ## Drug Possession
  Drug Possession is specifically the carrying of chemicals, substances, and/or any other drug-like entity in large quantities.

  ## Illegal Distribution (Drugs)
  Illegal Distribution is the distribution of a large quantity of drugs that are considered narcotics or do not serve a purpose outside
  of the medical bay or medicinal purposes. These can and should extend to drugs that are considered contrband as well.

  For further processing, this extends to willingly giving out drugs or equipment that can produce drugs in large quantities. This does not
  extend to a few pills or the likes that can be used recreationally. The exception being if the "recreational" use is violent in nature or
  harmful to crewmembers.
