  ## Animal Cruelty
  Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying.

      Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim.
