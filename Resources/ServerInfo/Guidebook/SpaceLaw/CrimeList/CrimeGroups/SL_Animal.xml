  # Animal Harm and Cruelty (A)
  Animal Harm and Animal Cruelty are two different crimes specifying the abuse/harm to station animals and personal pets.
  - This does not extend to pests that live on the station, such as mothroaches, mice, rats, lootbugs, and more.

  ## Animal Harm
  Animal harm is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that does not result in it going into a critical state.
  - A minor punch or so isn't worth charging over, an infraction warning being sufficient, but harming more than just a punch is worth investigating.

  ## Animal Cruelty
  Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying.
  - Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim.
