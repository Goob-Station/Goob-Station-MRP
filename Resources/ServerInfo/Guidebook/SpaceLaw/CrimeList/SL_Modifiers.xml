  - M-06: Resisting Arrest
  - M-07: Escaped Prisoner
  - M-08: Failure to Commit Crime

  ## M-01: Clear and Present Danger
  Clear and present danger can be assigned to charges where the individual was in a scenario where they commited the crime in
  the interest of saving life, property, and/or preventing a disaster.

  Such scenarios can be marked with this modifier to reduce, void, and/or expunge their charges from the records.

  <ColorBox>
    <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center">
      This is primarily used for situations where someone may have to commit a crime with good intention.
    </Box>
  </ColorBox>

  ## M-02: Repeat Sentencing
  Despite the name, this can also extend to a large scope of crimes where the sentencing would "repeat" in on itself for multiple
  stacked crimes. This modifier may be assigned to charges where the offender has done these crimes many times and thus the scope
  of the crimes has become large enough to process the charge higher.

  In English, this means that the modifier may be applied to increase the charge to the next level.

  <ColorBox>
    <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center">
      Primarily intended for uses where there are multiple infractions but not enough to warrant a full arrest. Can also be used for repetitive actions
      that lead to arrest where the individual continues to break the crime without stacking them high enough to be permanently brigged.
    </Box>
  </ColorBox>

  ## M-03: Self-Defense
  This modifier may be applied to charges where the offender of the crime was acting in self-defense against an assailant(s).

  This modifier allows the sentencer to reduce, void, and/or expunge the charge from the record.

  ## M-04: Mental Instability
  Those deemed to be unstable in the mind, acting erratically, or have lost control of themselves may be applied this modifier to their charges.

  This deems that an individual who is incapable of acting with a sense of normality, with sanity, may be treated medically or forcefully cryosleeped.

  <ColorBox>
    <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center">
      English: Insanity, Mind Control, Hypnosis, et cetera. This is intended to cover IC manipulation of the mind.
    </Box>
  </ColorBox>

  ## M-05: Coordinated Behavior
  This is a modifer that may be applied to those that move in groups as if they were a department of their own, ignoring the departments
  of the station and acting apart from the station.

  This modifier allows for the charge to be increased in severity by one instance.

  <ColorBox>
    <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center">
      English: You cannot act as a Passenger/Greytider and work against the station with others.
    </Box>
  </ColorBox>

  ## M-06: Resisting Arrest
  Anyone who is actively resisting a lawful arrest may have this modifier attached to their charges. Knowingly resisting arrest
  is a crime in of it's own and also falls under "Failure to Comply" (3-10).

  Anyone that is actively resisting arrest can be charged an extra 20% of their time (which cannot be applied to permanently brig someone).

  ## M-07: Escaped Prisoner
  Any prisoner that has escaped from the permanent brig or holding cell is bound to have this modifier added to their charges when they are caught.

  A prisoner that has escaped the holding cell should have the timer reset and increased by 50%. A permanent prisoner should be held in solitary for 2-4 minutes.

  ## M-08: Failure to Commit a Crime
  Anyone that is caught in the act or has failed to commit a crime in full may have their sentence reduced with this modifier depending on the severity of the crime.

  This modifier can be applied to reduce the severity by one level; however, this [bold]does not apply[/bold] to repeat offenders.
