  # Dr. Sherlock Watson v. NanoTrasen
  Dr. Sherlock Watson, a retired detective and psychologist extraordinaire decreed to NanoTrasen that cultish activities should be deemed a hostility
  and dealt with as an act against the Station(s) due to the danger it imposes on the general public and command personnel. Dr. Watson defined cultish
  activities as those involving unusual congregations of people from different positions with one goal to perform rituals and magics that defy the very
  nature of the universe, something that transcends knowledge.

  In his further explanations, Dr. Watson claimed that a cult with an unusual religion may seem innocent at first glance, but it could quickly turn into
  something more sinister when delving further in the investigation. While docile cults do exist, it should be, as Dr. Watson claimed, a necessity for command
  and security to investigate such congregations and ensure that they are not performing vile, dark acts in efforts to summon an abomination that they refer
  to as their "god".

  ## Rule Clarification
  - Cultists should be cleansed to revert their loyalty when possible, holy water seemingly doing the trick for such cases (injected or forcefed).
  - If a cultist cannot be cleansed, they must be eliminated to prevent potential escapes via teleportation or summoning.
  - Cultists must be confirmed hostile before killing them, such as proving they've killed and/or are actively fighting against the station.
  - All efforts must be focused on stopping a ritual summon if such an event were to happen.
