  # Solivon Ramus v. NanoTrasen
  Solivon Ramus escalated a court case to the point of NanoTrasen involvement from a simple station in the 42nd Quadrant Nebula. Solivon made the argument
  that the involvement of Epistemics during Glimmer bursts and Noospheric Storms are important, but that psionic users that are confirmed to not be using
  their powers maliciously should not be targets for sacrificing when attempting to reduce the dangerous glimmer levels that plague the station.

  Solivon Ramus claimed one of his friends, a fellow Service Worker on the NTDV Hammurabi Prison Station, was viciously targeted despite sharing his psionic
  abilities as per the law, and sacrificed without a say by the Chaplain and Mantis who dragged him to the altar. Solivon admitted to stealing the brain from
  the Chaplain that had done the deed, and taking them to the ICU in the Medical Department and transplanting it himself with his limited surgery skills into
  a monkey, claiming that converting a sacrificed individual into a borg was merely chaining them to a life of enslavement.

  Solivon Ramus agreed to face the charges for interfering with Epistemics work on White Alert, but declared that sacrificing psionic users that registered
  and followed the laws as set forth without givintg them the opportunity to remain tracked of mindbroken was no better than killing station personnel for
  existing in a state of crisis.

  ## Rule Clarification
  - The option for mindbreaking must be given to those that are being targeted on white alert; unless they are abusing their powers maliciously.
  - Psionic users that do not register should be given the option, but may be sacrificed if they're found to have powerful abilities.
  - Sacrifices should be done as a last resort, but transferring the mind to a new body, golem, or borg, is required no matter what.
