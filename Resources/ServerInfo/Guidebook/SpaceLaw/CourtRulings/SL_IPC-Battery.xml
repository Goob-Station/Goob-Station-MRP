  # Blitz-035 v. NanoTrasen
  In the court case Blitz-035 v. NanoTrasen, Blitz-035 voiced their concerns over the basic rights that all IPCs deserve when restrained in cells
  for committing crimes. Blitz-035 was a victim, in their argument, of intentional deprivation of their power cell to prevent them from acting in their
  cell. The Warden that had sentenced them, the one that stole it in question, took the power cell and left them on the floor for the duration of their
  crime charges.

  Blitz-035 argued that a power cell for an IPC is the equivalent of a food source and health checkup. That depriving one of reasonable power, whether it
  be preventing them from charging or outright removing their power cell, was a rights violation of the basic prisoner laws.

  ## Rule Clarification
  NanoTrasen has agreed and appended this case to the following court order:
  - IPC Prisoners should be given a means to charging, whether it be replacing their power cells with charged ones or supplying a connectionless APC
  for charging purposes.
  - IPC Prisoners are not to be deprived of their power cells while serving out sentences or permanent brigging, as such a case is a violation of
  basic prisoner rights.
