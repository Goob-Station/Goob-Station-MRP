  # Escalation Policy
  It is possible, when prisoners are causing issues and/or escalating their charges through violent, hostile, and/or other means, to escalate a prisoner's
  sentence to a higher severity, depending on the crimes.

  The Escalation Policy covers the following directives:
  - Criminals with a sentence of fifteen (15) minutes or more are to be tried in court for permanent brigging. Refusal to accept the trial is acceptance to
  the permanent brigging and such criminals are to be turned into prisoners.
  - Criminals with a sentence of twenty (20) minutes or more are to be immediately permanently brigged, demoted to a prisoner without a trial.
  - Criminals with a sentence of thirty (30) minutes or more are to be tried in court for execution, if the Magistrate and/or Captain approves of such a case
  to be accepted. Magistrate still overrules Captain if they disapprove.

  In such cases that the execution trial is followed through, one must follow the SOP [textlink="Executions" link="Execution SOP"] entry.
