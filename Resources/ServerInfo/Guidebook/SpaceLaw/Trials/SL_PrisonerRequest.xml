  # Prisoner Request Policy
  The Prisoner Request Policy covers the choices that Prisoners may request to bring to court and start a trial. This does not cover trials
  as a result of charges exceeding fifteen (15) minutes or more. This covers trials as a result of the request of a prisoner to defend themselves
  against charges they've incurred when deemed necessary.

  These policies are covered below:
  - Prisoners may only request a trial if they have met or exceeded fifteen (15) minutes of brig time, and are to be tried for permanent brigging.
  - Prisoners that are permanently brigged may request a trial for release if there are no other trials at the time.
  - Prisoners may request that prior charges be stricken from their record if they can provide evidence proving the charges to be false.
  - Prisoners have the right to appoint a representative lawyer to advocate on their behalf during the trial.
  - Should no lawyer be available, the prisoner may choose to represent themselves or appoint any willing crew member as their representative.
