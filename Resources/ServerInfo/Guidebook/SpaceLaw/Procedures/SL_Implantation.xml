  # Implantation Procedures
  Security and Command may enforce an Implantation of a Mental Shielding device, Tracking device, or other device legally made within the station
  or supplied by NanoTrasen, under certain circumstances and while following these guidelines.

  ## Implantation Rulings
  Implantation follows several rules and should be done when required by an emergency or reasonably believed to be the best outcome:
  - Any prisoner in custody can be subjected to implantation or implant removal procedures, so long as it's within reason.
  - The process of adding an implant should not prolong the detainees sentence, meaning you can not hold them longer to administer
  the implant, unless stated otherwise.
  - A former inmate can be requested to undergo implantation at a later point in time if they fit the circumstances during their confinement,
  they must comply.
  - Implantation is required, per the SOP, for personnel who are being promoted to a Head of Staff position.

  ## Special Circumstances
  The following have been listed out with special circumstances, anything not in this list can still be applied, given proper legal context:
  - A prisoner can still receive implantation procedures without meeting the circumstances if they give their consent, clearly.
  - [color=#a4885c]Tracking Implants:[/color] Trackers can be applied to any suspect that has been convicted of a violent crime.
  - [color=#a4885c]Mind Shields:[/color] Shields can be administered to any inmate who has been clearly mind controlled, lost control of themselves,
  or a suspect charged with unlawful control.
  - Unlike standard implantation you may hold a prisoner until you finish issuing Mind Shields, so long as it's done in a timely fashion.
  - If a suspect refuses to cooperate or the implant fails to function they can be charged with Refusal of Mental Shielding.
