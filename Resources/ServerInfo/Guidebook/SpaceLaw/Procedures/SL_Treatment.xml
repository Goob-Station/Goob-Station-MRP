  # Treatment of Prisoners
  Prisoners deserve the same treatment as everybody else; albeit having reduced access and a limited cell. These treatments are simple, the rights
  to remain clothed, healthy, and given access to communications.

  Simply put, Prisoners still have certain rights that must be upheld by law enforcement:
  - Prisoners must be granted adequate medical care, treated swiftly and ensured to not suffer, remain critically injured, nor rot.
  - Prisoners must be allowed access to basic communications equipment (Radios/Headsets) so long as they are not abused.
  - Prisoners must be granted clothing, food, water, shelter and safety. If the brig is no longer safe, confinement must be established in another location.
  - Prisoners must be given access to legal counsel during an interrogation if requested and available.
  - Prisoners must be given their shift mandated PDA after confinement has finished, unless there is solid proof of PDA tampering.
  In case of tampering, the PDA is to be secured and replaced with a new unit and noted as a charge in the event that it wasn't included already.
  - Prisoners must be granted freedom of movement, and should not be restrained with handcuffs or other devices after incarceration unless
  there is an undue risk to life and limb.
  - Similarly, any prisoners held for permanent confinement should be held in the communal brig, and should not be confined to a
  solitary cell unless they pose a risk to life and limb.
