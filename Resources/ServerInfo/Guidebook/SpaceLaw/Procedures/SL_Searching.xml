  # Search and Seizure Procedures
  Security and Command have to follow procedures for searching based on Alert Level and these guidelines. These procedures should be known
  to the public for the purpose of ensuring rights are protected.

  ## Personnel Searches
  Personnel Searches, simply put, are the procedures as follows:
  - A personnel search is a seizure of the objects in a person's backpack, hands, coat, belt, and pockets.
  - If any contraband is found during a search, the officer may choose to further the search into a detainment or simply confiscate the restricted items.
  - After the search is conducted, all legal items are to be returned to the person.
  - A crewmate may legally decline any search conducted without probable cause or a warrant while the alert level is green.
  - [italic]It should be noted that if the alert level is blue or above, all personnel searches are legal.[/italic]

  ## Department Searches
  Department Searches, simply put, are the procedures as follows:
  - A departmental search is the sweep of an entire area or department for contraband.
  - It is recommended that the officers be extremely thorough, checking all lockers, crates, and doors.
  - These can only be done with permission or, ideally, a warrant signed by the department head or highest-ranking command staff,
  which is the captainin most cases.
