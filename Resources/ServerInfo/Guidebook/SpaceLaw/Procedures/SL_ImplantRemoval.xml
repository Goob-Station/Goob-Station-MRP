  # Implant Removal Procedures
  There are several guidelines around the removal of known, and unknown, implants within a suspect, criminal, or prisoner. These guidelines are outlined
  below and show the proper procedures that should be followed while removing implants, and justifying it in Space Law.

  ## Guidelines
  These guidelines, outlining the process and procedures for removing implants, are shown below:
  - A suspect can be forced to receive implant removal if there is strong, reasonable proof that they have been implanted,
  such as an officer seeing them use one or their prints being on a discarded injector.
  - Unlike the implantation procedure, a prisoner can have their sentence entirely delayed or extended until they comply with the procedure,
  as long as security is actively making attempts to perform it.
  - Akin to implanting, if an inmate gives their clear permission, implant removal can proceed without proof.

  ## Rules
  These are non-negotiable rules for defining how implantation removal may be performed:
  - Implant removal should only be performed, [color=#EB2D3A][bold]which is also defined in the metashield[/bold][/color], if reasonable suspicion
  is founded that an individual has an implant.
  - Finding prints or seeing implants being used is justifiable, as stated above.
  - NanoTrasen knows about implants. They have Mindshield, Tracking, and Lifeline implants.
  - NanoTrasen does not inherently inform its station personnel of any other implantation devices that are out there, so assume they do not exist.
